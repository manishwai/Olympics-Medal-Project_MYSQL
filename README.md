This is a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016.
Note that the Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year up until 1992.
After that, they staggered them such that Winter Games occur on a four year cycle starting with 1994,
then Summer in 1996, then Winter in 1998, and so on.
